# reverse-engineering

Reverse engineer the starter code provided and create a tutorial for the code.

In the Develop folder, there is starter code for a project. Begin inspecting the code to get an understanding of each file's responsibility. Then, in a Google Doc, write a tutorial explaining every file and its purpose. If one file is dependant on other files, be sure to let the user know.

AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project
